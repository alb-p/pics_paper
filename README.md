# Outgrowing Asimov: The Inadequacy of the Three Laws in AI Development

## Overview

This repository contains the paper "Outgrowing Asimov: The Inadequacy of the Three Laws in AI Development," written for the course Philosophical Issues of Computer Science @Polimi (2022-23).

## Abstract

This paper analyzes the limitations of Asimov’s Laws of Robotics in ensuring the safe and ethical development of AI technologies. While influential, these laws fall short in addressing real-world ethical dilemmas. The paper examines ambiguities in the laws, challenges in defining 'harm' and 'human being,' and difficulties in implementing these principles in AI systems. Using examples like the Trolley Problem, AI driving systems, and military applications, it highlights the growing gap between Asimov’s laws and modern AI ethics. The paper calls for comprehensive, globally collaborative ethical guidelines for AI development.
